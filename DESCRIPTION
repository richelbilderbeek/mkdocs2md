Description: MkDocs is a popular website generator
  that converts markdown to static HTML.
  MkDocs extends markdown.
  However, these markdown extensions are unknown
  to tools that convert markdown to other text
  formats.
  This package allows one to convert the MkDocs
  markdown extensions to regular markdown.
